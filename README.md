# Go Implementation of [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)

This is an implementation of WireGuard in Go, but connect to vpp by libmemif instead of use tun device in linux kernel.

## Additional Environment Variables

	VPP_MEMIF_SOCKET_DIR
	VPP_MEMIF_CONFIG_DIR
	VPP_SOCKET_DIR

## Usage

Similar to original wireguard-go, but you have to configure some config for the memif.

Create a json file in `/etc/wggo-vpp/wg0.json` with following content:

```
{
    "uid": 3,
    "secret": "pwd",
    "GatewayMacAddr": "42:42:42:42:42:42",
    "IPv4ArpResponseRanges": [ "192.168.37.128/30" ],
    "IPv4ArpLearningRanges": [ "192.168.37.0/24" ],
    "IPv6NdpNeighAdvRanges": [ "fd42::/64" ],
    "IPv6NdpLearningRanges": [ "fd42::/64" ],
    "VppBridgeID": 4242
}

```

### JSON parameters
1. uid: Unique ID for vpp interface id, must be unique in the vpp runtime.
2. secret: the secret for the connection between vpp and wggo-vpp
3. IPv4ArpResponseRanges: While DstIP in this range, it will reply the ARP if an ARP request packet received.
4. IPv6NdpNeighAdvRanges: Similar to `IPv4ArpResponseRanges`, but it replies Neighbor Advertisement if a Neighbor Solicitation received.
5. GatewayMacAddr: The mac address of the gateway. If the dstIP out of the learning range defined below will use this Mac address in the vpp side.
6. IPv4ArpLearningRanges(Optional): Any dstIP within this range, the MacAddress are required to be learned
7. IPv6NdpLearningRanges(Optional): Same to `IPv4ArpLearningRanges`, but IPv6 version

While the JSON configured, you can run wireguard-go-vpp via following command:

```
$ wireguard-go wg0
```

This will create an memory interface in the vpp and fork into the background. 

It will automatically remove the interface while closing. To remove the interface manually, use this command in the vppcli
```
delete interface memif memif3/3
delete memif socket id 3
```
You may instead remove the control socket via `rm -f /var/run/wireguard/wg0.sock`, which will result in wireguard-go shutting down.

To run wireguard-go without forking to the background, pass `-f` or `--foreground`:

```
$ wireguard-go -f wg0
```

When an interface is running, you may use [`wg(8)`](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8) to configure it, as well as the usual `ip(8)` and `ifconfig(8)` commands.

To run with more logging you may set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

## Platforms

Only linux are tested, other platform may work but I am not sure.


## Building

This requires an installation of [go](https://golang.org) â‰¥ 1.16.

```
$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go
$ cd wireguard-go
$ make
```
