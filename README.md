# Go Implementation of [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)

This is an implementation of WireGuard in Go, but connect to vpp by libmemif instead of use tun device in linux kernel.

## Environment Variables

	VPP_MEMIF_SOCKET_DIR
	VPP_MEMIF_CONFIG_DIR
	VPP_API_SOCKET_PATH


* VPP_API_SOCKET_PATH
    * default value: `/run/vpp/api.sock`
    * The api socket to connect to vpp
* VPP_MEMIF_SOCKET_DIR
    * default value: `/var/run/wggo-vpp`
    * The folder to put socket files to communicate between vpp and wggo-vpp
* VPP_MEMIF_CONFIG_DIR
    * Default value: `/etc/wggo-vpp`
    * The folder to put configs 

## Usage

You have to setup vpp first. Start VPP and run following command in vppcli

if you want to run it in pure userspace, remember to set dpdk config to `"no-pci no-hugetlb"`

Remember to replace the IP Range/MacAddr/BridgeID/InstanceID to what you want

In this case, InstanceID=42 / BridgeID=4242 / MacAddr=42:42:42:42:42:42
```
loop create mac 42:42:42:42:42:42 instance 42
set int l2 bridge loop42 4242 bvi
set interface mtu 1500 loop42
set int state loop42 up

set interface ip address loop42 192.168.37.1/24
set interface ip address loop42 fd42:4242:4242::1/10
```

Similar to original wireguard-go, but you have to configure some config for the memif.

Create a json file in `/etc/wggo-vpp/wg0.json` with following content:

```
{
    "uid": 3,
    "secret": "pwd",
    "GatewayMacAddr": "42:42:42:42:42:42",
    "IPv4ArpResponseRanges": [ "192.168.37.128/30" ],
    "IPv4ArpLearningRanges": [ "192.168.37.0/24" ],
    "IPv6NdpNeighAdvRanges": [ "fd42::/64" ],
    "IPv6NdpLearningRanges": [ "fd42::/64" ],
    "VppBridgeID": 4242
}

```

### parameters
1. uid: Unique ID for vpp interface id, must be unique in the vpp runtime.
2. secret: the secret for the connection between vpp and wggo-vpp
3. IPv4ArpResponseRanges: While DstIP in this range, it will reply the ARP if an ARP request packet received.
4. IPv6NdpNeighAdvRanges: Similar to `IPv4ArpResponseRanges`, but it replies Neighbor Advertisement if a Neighbor Solicitation received.
5. GatewayMacAddr: The mac address of the gateway. If the dstIP out of the learning range defined below, it will use this Mac address as DstMacAddr in the vpp side.
6. IPv4ArpLearningRanges(Optional): Any dstIP within this range, wggo-vpp will lookup it's the MacAddr in the ARP table to fill the layer 2 part. If the lookup failed, it will send an ARP request and drop the original packet.
7. IPv6NdpLearningRanges(Optional): Same as `IPv4ArpLearningRanges`, but IPv6 version

While the JSON configured, you can run wireguard-go-vpp via following command:

```
$ wireguard-go wg0
```

This will create an memif in the vpp and fork into the background. 

To connect to peers, just like original wireguard-go, use wireguard-tool but use custom userspace implantation

Remember to replace the path to real path
```
export WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=$HOME/wireguard-go-vpp/wireguard-go
wg setconf wg0 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```
Root permission is not required but you need the read/write access at `/run/vpp/api/api.sock`, `/var/run/vpp-memif-wg` and `/etc/wggo-vpp`. Or you can change the path by environment variables.

`wg-quick` are not supported now.

It will automatically remove the interface while closing. To remove the interface manually, use this command in the vppcli (assume the uid is 3)
```
delete interface memif memif3/3
delete memif socket id 3
```
You may instead remove the control socket via `rm -f /var/run/wireguard/wg0.sock`, which will result in wireguard-go shutting down.

To run wireguard-go without forking to the background, pass `-f` or `--foreground`:

```
$ wireguard-go -f wg0
```

When an interface is running, you may use [`wg(8)`](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8) to configure it.

To run with more logging you may set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

## Make userspace apps join VPP network

Remember to replace the path to real path
```
export VCL_VPP_API_SOCKET="/run/vpp/api.sock"
export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libvcl_ldpreload.so"
```

## Platforms

Only linux are tested, other platform may work but I am not sure.


## Building

This requires an installation of [go](https://golang.org) â‰¥ 1.16.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KusakabeSi/wireguard-go-vpp
$ cd wireguard-go-vpp
$ make
```
